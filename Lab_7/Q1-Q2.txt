Q1-Q2

Q1. If temp was already the value at the top of the stack.
Q2. In proc we set a variable to 0 so that when temp is is dereferenced it is zero. This will guarantee the crash because adress zero does not exist.

2 lines of chanes from swap1 to swap2

To crash temp must be 0. Force seg fault. no address zero. temp is a pointer that countains address
anytime you define a variable, you strore in stack. when you free somethin it is zero

nchoose k:
push all save as reisters to stack
call them back when they were done, jump back to ra. chane stack pointer
